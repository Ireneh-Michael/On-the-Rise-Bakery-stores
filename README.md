![](BAKERY%2C.png)
---
## Introduction

This project was solely to collect sales data using Google form and analyze the data using Google sheet from an imaginary store **On the Rise Bakery stores**. The project is to uncover insights to answer some of the critical questions concerning which products are selling the best and which locations are doing well, and which of the locations may need some additional support in the next fiscal year in the AsiaPac region.

As we all know, Google sheets is one of the most popular cloud-based spreadsheet applications developed by Google as a part of Google Workspace. It is very similar to MS Excel as it enables us to create and edit our data on spreadsheets and enables us to share our spreadsheets with our co-workers or peers online.
Apart from creating, editing, and sharing spreadsheets, it also provides tons of features for data analysis, automation using formulas and charting. Charting is one of the common usages of Google Spreadsheets. Charting in Google sheets means visually representing the data in a more interactive and user-friendly way using line-charts, bar-charts, pie-charts and more. These charts help us better understand the trends and patterns within our data. Google Sheets provides us built-in tools for charting which allows us to create, customize, embed charts in our spreadsheets easily and present our data in a clear and visually appealing manner.
